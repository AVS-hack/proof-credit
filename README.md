# Proof of Credit

Proof of Credit is an on-chain credit scoring system designed to utilize data from both blockchain and real-world sources to create a transparent, reliable, and decentralized credit scoring platform. This project enables users to generate verified credit scores based on their blockchain activities and external behaviors, helping them secure credit or loans within the digital finance ecosystem.

## Project Overview

Proof of Credit addresses the need for a fair, transparent, and comprehensive credit scoring system in the digital finance world. By integrating both on-chain (blockchain-based) and off-chain (real-world) data, this application provides a more accurate reflection of a user's creditworthiness. With Proof of Credit, individuals can establish a verifiable credit score within a decentralized framework, making decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible and inclusive.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Credit Scoring**: Utilizes both blockchain activity and real-world data to assess user creditworthiness.
- **Transparent and Secure**: Built on Ethereum, ensuring transparency and data integrity.
- **Automatic Verification Systems (AVS)**: Leverages AVS to automate data verification and processing for accurate scoring.
- **Mock Data Simulation**: Enables testing and development by simulating real-world credit data in a decentralized context.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For building smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime for application logic.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend and backend development.
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform for deploying smart contracts.
- **web3.js**: JavaScript library for Ethereum integration.
- **AVS (Automatic Verification Systems)**: System for gathering and validating both on-chain and off-chain data.
- **Mock Data API**: Simulates real-world data for testing purposes.

## Challenges Faced

Creating a reliable decentralized credit scoring system posed several challenges:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Securing accurate, relevant credit data is complex, as decentralized credit scoring is still an emerging field.
2. **AVS Implementation**: Effectively utilizing AVS to interpret both on-chain and off-chain data required extensive testing with mock data.
